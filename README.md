# School HTML Project
This repository contains my school project where I created a website with a home page, a product page 
and a contact page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website is a mock-up of an online store. 
The project demonstrates my beginnings in web development.

## Features
The website has the following features:
- A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- A navigation bar that allows users to switch between different pages
- A home page that displays a welcome message
- A product page that displays a list of products and their descriptions
- A contact page
